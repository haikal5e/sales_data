# Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes sales transaction data to uncover business insights and patterns. Using Python and MySQL, I explored order records to identify top-performing products, geographic sales trends, and key financial metrics. The analysis includes data cleaning and SQL queries for aggregations to support data-driven decision-making.

## Key Insights:
- Calculated total revenue and profit margins
- Identified best-selling products and cities
- Analyzed sales distributions and order trends
- Verified data quality through null checks

## Tools Used:
- Python
- MySQL
- Pandas
- SQL Queries

## About the Dataset

- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order
- **Product**: Name of the purchased item
- **Quantity Ordered**: Number of units ordered
- **Price Each**: Price per unit of product
- **Sales**: Calculated (Quantity Ordered Ã— Price Each)
- **City**: Extracted from Purchase Address
